# Fuzzy

Example for local robot framework application.

## Primary Source repository

The main source of `fuzzy` is on a mountain in central Switzerland.
We use distributed version control (git).
There is no central hub.
Every clone can become a new source for the benefit of all.
The preferred public clones of `fuzzy` are:

* [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sthagen/fuzzy) - a democratic community-driven, non-profit software development platform operated by Codeberg e.V.
* [at sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/fuzzy) - a collection of tools useful for software development.

## Status

Experimental.

**Note**: The default branch is `default`.
