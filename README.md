# fuzzy

Example for local robot framework application.

## Primary Source repository

The primary source of `fuzzy` lives somewhere on a mountain in Central Switzerland.
But, we use decentralized version control (git), so any clone can become the source to everyone's benefit, no central only code.
Anyway, the preferred public clones of `fuzzy` are:

* [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sthagen/fuzzy) - a collaboration platform and git hosting for free and open source software, content and projects.
* [at sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/fuzzy) - a collection of tools useful for software development.

## Status

Experimental.

**Note**: The default branch is `default`.
