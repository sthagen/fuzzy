# Example local node robot framework setup
There is some fuzzy app. There are developer unit tests.

Add system level declarative, data driven keyword tests per robot framework.

## Primary Source repository

The primary source of `fuzzy` lives somewhere on a mountain in Central Switzerland.
But, we use decentralized version control (git), so any clone can become the source to everyone's benefit, no central only code.
Anyway, the preferred public clones of `fuzzy` are:

* [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sthagen/fuzzy) - a collaboration platform and git hosting for free and open source software, content and projects.
* [at sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/fuzzy) - a collection of tools useful for software development.
