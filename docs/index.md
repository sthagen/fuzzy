# Example local node robot framework setup
There is some fuzzy app. There are developer unit tests.

Add system level declarative, data driven keyword tests per robot framework.

## Primary Source repository

The main source of `fuzzy` is on a mountain in central Switzerland.
We use distributed version control (git). No central hub. Each clone can become a new source for the benefit of all.
The preferred public clones of `fuzzy` are:

* [on codeberg](https://codeberg.org/sthagen/fuzzy) - a democratic community-driven, non-profit software development platform operated by Codeberg e.V.
* [at sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~sthagen/fuzzy) - a collection of tools useful for software development.
